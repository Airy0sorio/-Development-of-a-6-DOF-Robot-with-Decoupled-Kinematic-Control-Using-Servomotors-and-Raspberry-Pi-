# -Development-of-a-6-DOF-Robot-with-Decoupled-Kinematic-Control-Using-Servomotors-and-Raspberry-Pi-
This project involves designing and implementing a 6-DOF robotic arm controlled by a Raspberry Pi, which calculates joint angles based on user inputs. The system utilizes six servomotors for movement, with PWM signals managed via serial communication with an Arduino Uno.
