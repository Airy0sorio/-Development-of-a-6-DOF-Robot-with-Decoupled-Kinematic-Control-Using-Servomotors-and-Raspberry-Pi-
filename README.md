# Development of a 6 DOF Robot with Decoupled Kinematic Control Using Servomotors and Raspberry Pi
This project involves designing and implementing a 6-DOF robotic arm controlled by a Raspberry Pi, which calculates the angles of the joints as a function of the position vector and the Euler angles entered by the user using kinematic and inverse decoupling. . The system utilizes six servomotors for movement, with PWM signals managed via serial communication with an Arduino Uno.
